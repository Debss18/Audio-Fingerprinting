This project aims to write a scaled-down version of an audio fingerprinting algorithm. Two functions are created in this project, one for extracting
spectrogram peaks and one for extracting combinatorial hashes. A result analysis is conducted by comparing the hashes generated for a segment of a song against hashes generated for the entire song,
as well hashes generated for two other (different) songs. There is a clear result for which song is the fingerprint.
